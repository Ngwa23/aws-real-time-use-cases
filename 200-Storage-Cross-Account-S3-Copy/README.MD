# Transfer ownership of Amazon S3 objects to a different AWS account.		

## Scenario
Your client has a team of developers using `Account A` to create assets to be used in the production site hosted in `Account B`. As the cloud engineer your client expects you to set up automated copy of S3 Objects in `Account A` to S3 bucket in `Account B` and ensure that `Acccount B` can modify/change the permissions of the objects to suit their deployment requirements.


0. ## Prerequisites
    - Two AWS Accounts 
        - Source account:`Account A`
        - Destination Account:`Account B`
    - S3 Buckets in Account `A` & `B`
    - AWS CLI Access for both the accounts
    
1. ## Setup Tools 
    Letâ€™s prepare the two accounts. Ensure you have two buckets `sourcebucket` and `destinationbucket`. _Change to your bucket names_. Install and configure AWS CLI with two different profiles for Account `A` & `B`.

1. ## Step 2. Source Account S3bucket
    - Create a `sourcebucket` in a Region (eg.,Mumbai) ,in the `Account A`
    - Upload sample files onto this bucket, that will be transferred to destination account.
    - Attachthe below mentioned permissions into the Bucket policy;
    ```json
    {
    "Id": "Policy1541018284691",
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1541018283275",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            },
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::YOUR-DEV-ACCOUNT-NUMBER:user/iam-username"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

1. ## Destination Account S3bucket

    - Create a `destinationbucket` in Ireland Region,in the `Account B`
    - Attach the below mentioned permissions into the Bucket policy;
        ```json
       {
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1357935677554",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1357935647218",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR-DEV-ACCOUNT-NUMBER:user/iam-username"
            },
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DESTINATION BUCKET NAME"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1357935676138",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR-DEV-ACCOUNT-NUMBER:user/iam-username"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DESTINATION BUCKET NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}

 ```
 
 
    **Note:** _The Source account's ACCOUNT NUMBER can be figured by going to the SOURCE ACCOUNT's CONSOLE, then click SUPPORT, choose Support center and there you     will find the account number as : `xxxxxxxxxxxx`_

 1. ## Verify S3 Copying & Ownership:
    - Go to the AWS CLI, Configure AWS using the script : `aws configure`. Transfer ojects from the Source Bucket to Destination Bucket using the command as below:
        ```sh
        aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket DestinationBucket --key ObjectName --acl bucket-owner-full-control
        ```
        The above command will provide full control of the object to the bucket owner (Destination bucket owner).
        
    - If you want to copy multiple objects to the bucket, then try this command instead
    
        ```sh
       aws s3 cp s3://SOURCE BUCKET NAME/ s3://DESTINATION BUCKET NAME/ --acl bucket-owner-full-control --recursive
        ```
    - The above CLI scripts will copy all the S3 objects accross AWS accounts, also ending up in transferring the `FULL CONTROLL` to the destination account.

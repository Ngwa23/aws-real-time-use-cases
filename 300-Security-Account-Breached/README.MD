1. What actions will you take to ? & What order will you take those actions?

- Change  AWS account root user password.

This makes it possible to simply view findings in GuardDuty or push them to an existing SIEM or workflow system. Weâ€™ve already seen customers take it a step further using AWS Lambda to automate actions such as changing security groups, isolating instances, or rotating credentials.
   - we should enable CloudTrail logging so you are alerted whenever instances are spun up
